<h2 id="the-quest-for-the-holy-grail">The quest for the Holy Grail</h2>

<p>A job spec that developers relate to is a rare sight.</p>

<p>I was chatting with an acquaintance that works in the recruiting space, about the never-ending battle between good an evil that is <a href="/tech/recruiters-vs-devs-the-eternal-struggle/">the relationship between recruiters and developers</a>. The conversation got interesting when he said this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not sure our job specs are very good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At that point, I had a fleeting recollection that while on Twitter, I stumbled on the <a href="https://zapier.com/about/">Zapier jobs page</a>. Specifically I had a look at the <a href="https://zapier.com/jobs/product-engineer-fall-2016/">Product Engineer spec</a>. I also took a <a href="/images/zapier-job-spec.png">screenshot</a> of the spec, for when they find their perfect candidate and the page gets removed!</p>

<p>I am always wowed by the quality they show in their job specs.</p>

<h2 id="ease-the-application-process">Ease the application process</h2>

<p>Zapier understands that even applying for a job can be daunting. This passage sums it up:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We know applying for and taking on a new a job at any company requires a leap of faith. We want you to feel comfortable and excited to apply at Zapier. To help share a bit more about life at Zapier, here are a few resources in addition to the job description that can give you an inside look at what life is like at Zapier. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll take the leap of faith and apply.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is great. Having stuff like a company code of conduct, a remote work policy, and/or a description of what the day to day of what working for the company looks like, can be beneficial to the amount of applications you&rsquo;ll receive.</p>

<h2 id="lay-out-the-challenges">Lay out the challenges</h2>

<p>If your company works on something interesting and unusual, let that emerge. Interesting problems can range from GIS, to machine learning, to simply scale up a part of the system the candidate will be working on.</p>

<p>Specify what processes you use on your day-to-day: how invested is the company on practices like TDD or pair programming? What&rsquo;s your current stack? Do you plan to change what the stack is made of in a few months/years?</p>

<h2 id="no-bullet-point-requirements">No &ldquo;bullet point&rdquo; requirements</h2>

<p>Many specs will list in a very dry way what they expect the candidate to know or be experienced with. Zapier explains in a nice way <em>who</em> they&rsquo;re looking for, hot <em>what</em> they&rsquo;re looking for.</p>

<p>Hard requirements can sometimes be intimidating. Many good developers are often on the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; side of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger</a> curve. They will see that 3 years of experience are required, and if they have 2 years of experience they will not apply. We&rsquo;re pedantic, keep it in mind.</p>

<p>Zapier also helps with this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of how well you feel you fit our description, we encourage you to apply if [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, when you hire someone, they&rsquo;ll shape the position more than the position will shape them.</p>

<h2 id="it-s-not-about-the-employer">It&rsquo;s not about the employer</h2>

<p>No need to loiter too long on what the company does; if I&rsquo;m on the page it&rsquo;s quite likely I know about the company already. Much better to talk about the company&rsquo;s philosophy, and what happens at the company outside of working hours. A list of social events, a description of a day at the office (or on the Slack channel, if 100% remote); things like these can give a picture about the culture, and can give a strong signal to the candidate on whether the company is a good fit or not.</p>

<p>A good candidate will do their due diligence anyway, learning as much as possible about the business.</p>

<h2 id="github-is-a-bad-source-of-truth">GitHub is a bad source of truth</h2>

<p>Zapier takes a sensible approach to open source contributions from the candidate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Include links to your portfolio/Github profile or provide us with 500+ LOC to help us get a feel for how you write code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the candidate is active on OSS projects, good. Otherwise Zapier also accepts a sample. This is crucial.</p>

<p>Most developers, unfortunately, work in environments that take a lot from open source but don&rsquo;t contribute back as much as they should. This means that developers don&rsquo;t build up an OSS portfolio during working hours. And they may not be in a position to come up with weekend projects: they may have a family to be with, or simply they may have a slew of interests and can&rsquo;t be bothered to code during their spare time. That doesn&rsquo;t subtract from what kind of asset they can be for your company.</p>

<h2 id="tl-dr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>So, to sum up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Show what the company is like, not what it does</li>
<li>List what challenges the successful candidate will have to tackle</li>
<li>Talk about the candidate more than you talk about the company</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use hard requirements, e.g.: years of experience; give an idea of what you&rsquo;re looking for instead</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t filter based on the GitHub profile</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this helps. Let me know in the comments if you have other things you look for in a job spec!</p>
